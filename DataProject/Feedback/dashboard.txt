Thomas Olsen:
"Good ideas for topics and graphs. Make sure to put graphs in tabs to separate them out."

Adam Gao:
"I liked the histograms and the violin plots. It all made sense to me"

Nathan Sheets (non-classmate):
"Put background of data before the tabs"
"Can you smooth the graphs more?"
"Can you remove the outlier for the USD price over time?"


My response: 
I will put the background about the data before the tabs and an explanation of each variable under the tabs. I will smooth the graphs and remove the USD price outlier if I have time.

Creating the dashboard was fun. 
I faced the challenge that my plots were bleeding into each other. After a lot of trial and error figuring out this was the issue, I added "clear_figure=True" to each plot to fix the issue.
I also ran into some issues with adding text to the dashboard in new lines, so I just added the text in separate objects.
Feedback was valuale, especially from a non classmate so I could make the dashboard more usable for someone from a non-data background.
