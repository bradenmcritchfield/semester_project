Thomas Olsen:
"Good ideas for topics and graphs. Make sure to put graphs in tabs to separate them out."

Adam Gao:
"I liked the histograms and the violin plots. It all made sense to me"

Nathan Sheets (non-classmate):
"Put background of data before the tabs"
"Can you smooth the graphs more?"
"Can you remove the outlier for the USD price over time?"


My response: 
I will put the background about the data before the tabs and an explanation of each variable under the tabs.
