I chose the research topic how does features of a board game (number of players, length of time, etc.) impact its popularity.
I went through a lot of different research ideas, including high school cross country times, tour de france times, and the educational composition of Congress.

Hwever, after talking to Thomas Olse, Joe Bradley, and Camilla McKinnon, I received the feedback that these ideas were either not original or not creative enough.
They did like my board game idea though and helped me figure out how to use the api on boardgamesgeek.com (i needed a list of IDs to make it work, which I ended up getting from a .csv file on their website)

They also suggested I think of ways I could involve predictive modelling in my research, so as I scraped data, I looked for variables that culd help predict the final rating.
