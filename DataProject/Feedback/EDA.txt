"I liked it. It made sense to me and you answered some important questions."

Thomas Olsen:
You should consider fixing your graphs (some stuff got cutoff), adjusting your titles for readability, and maybe only have the most important graphs.

Aaron Ostrich:
Link to your previous post in the first reference
Use a list for justfying what outliers you removed
labels are cutoff in some plots
There is a typo in the header
center your plots
Expand your conclusion to wrap things up nicer.

My response:
Great feedback! I'll implement this.

My blog became more readable and I avoided obvious blunders because of feedback.
